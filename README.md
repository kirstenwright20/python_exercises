This repository contains my solutions to Google's Basic Python Exercises.
The exercises are copyrighted by Google.
Basically, I'm putting this on here so I can diff my solutions on Google's easily.
Google's solutions will be in the master, my solutions will be in branches.
I'll try to add some comments about the differences and what I learned along the way!
